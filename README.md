## Configuration and Setup

Node version is managed with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
`.nvmrc` file can be used to specify nodeJS version used for the project.
`nvm use` or `nvm install` command would respect the `.nvmrc` file and detect the node version specified in the .nvmrc file and would install or switch to that specific nodeJS version.
